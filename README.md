# Basic-Machine-Learning-Methods
## Implementation of multiple basic machine learning methods using numpy.

This repository shows how to implement the basic machine learning methods using numpy rather than the exsiting and converient library, in order to understand the underlying theorems of ML.

The reference Textbook is:

Spesifically, each implementation is to solve a concrete problem. So I will share the corresponding problem setting in a PDF file.
